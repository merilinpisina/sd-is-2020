# Quick Sort vs Merge Sort


## Partition of elements in the array:
---

- ### In the merge sort, the array is parted into just 2 halves (i.e. n/2).

*whereas*

- ### In case of quick sort, the array is parted into any ratio. There is no compulsion of dividing the array of elements into equal parts in quick sort.


## Worst case complexity:
---

- ### The worst case complexity of quick sort is O(n2) as there is need of lot of comparisons in the worst condition.

*whereas*

- ### In merge sort, worst case and average case has same complexities O(n log n).


## Usage with datasets:
---

- ### Merge sort can work well on any type of data sets irrespective of its size (either large or small).

*whereas*

- ### The quick sort cannot work well with large datasets.


## Additional storage space requirement:
---

- ### Merge sort is not in place because it requires additional memory space to store the auxiliary arrays.

*whereas*

- ### The quick sort is in place as it doesnâ€™t require any additional storage.


## Efficiency:
---

- ### Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.

*whereas*

- ### Quick sort is more efficient and works faster than merge sort in case of smaller array size or datasets.


## Sorting method:
---

- ### The quick sort is internal sorting method where the data is sorted in main memory.

*whereas*

- ### The merge sort is external sorting method in which the data that is to be sorted cannot be accommodated in the memory and needed auxiliary memory for sorting.


## Stability:
---

- ### Merge sort is stable as two elements with equal value appear in the same order in sorted output as they were in the input unsorted array.

*whereas*

- ### Quick sort is unstable in this scenario. But it can be made stable using some changes in code.


## Preferred for:
---

- ### Quick sort is preferred for arrays.

*whereas*

- ### Merge sort is preferred for linked lists.


## Locality of reference:
---

- ### Quicksort exhibits good cache locality and this makes quicksort faster than merge sort (in many cases like in virtual memory environment).
